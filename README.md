<h2 align="center">Projects</h2>

### Neuroimaging using AI
I am part of multiple research groups and currently focusing on projects leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance neuroimaging analysis. By developing new and integrating already validated algorithms and techniques, we aim to automate the extraction and analysis of intricate neuroimaging features, enabling comprehensive investigations into brain structure and function - both pathological and physiological. With these improvements we hope to pave the way for more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment strategies.


### Microscopy Image Analysis using AI
In collaboration with esteemed institutions in Germany and the USA, I have started projects utilizing AI for microscopy image analysis. By harnessing advanced machine learning algorithms specifically designed for segmenting microscopy images, our main objective is to enhance the efficiency of swiftly and accurately identifying cellular and subcellular structures and pathological features to create objetive and quantifiable data from unstructured images. These projects are accelerating discoveries in basic research and improving precision in the assessment of pathological changes.


### Clinical Data Analysis using Machine Learning and Data Science Algorithms
In my research endeavors, I extensively employ machine learning and data science algorithms to analyze complex clinical datasets. By leveraging these powerful tools, we have gained valuable insights, identified patterns, and made informed decisions in various clinical research domains. These projects have contributed to - and continue to do so - enhanced treatment strategies and advanced medical knowledge.
